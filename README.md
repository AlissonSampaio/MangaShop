# MangaShop  

**A Role‑Play Full‑Stack Learning Project**  
This project was created as a practical, hands‑on approach to teaching full‑stack development through a role‑playing scenario. It illustrates core concepts like front‑to‑back communication, application flow, and developer collaboration, all implemented in TypeScript.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend / Backend**: TypeScript (shared environment)  
- (Describe if UI frameworks, backend frameworks, tools are used — adjust conforme necessidade)

---

## Project Vision
The primary goal is **educational**: to provide a clear and immersive learning experience that simulates real-world development challenges.  
By adopting a role‑play context (e.g., developer, client, reviewer), this project encourages an engaging learning path that emphasizes understanding, not just coding.

## Project Overview
```
src/
 ┣ (e.g., frontend/)  → Frontend app structure
 ┣ (e.g., backend/)   → API and server logic
 ┣ (e.g., shared/)    → Shared TypeScript types and utilities
 ┗ tests/             → Unit and integration test suite
```
